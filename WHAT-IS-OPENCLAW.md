# What Is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source personal AI assistant that lives on your computer (or server) and stays running all the time. You can talk to it from your phone, your browser, or your terminal—and it can actually do things on your system.

## The Simple Pitch

Imagine if you could text an AI assistant and say:

- "Check my downloads folder and summarize any new PDFs"
- "Find all the invoices from last month and organize them"
- "Open Chrome, go to this website, and fill out this form"
- "Remind me about this every Monday at 9am"

That's OpenClaw. It's not just a chatbot—it's an agent that can take action.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT or Claude?

ChatGPT and Claude are great for conversations, but they live in a browser tab. They can't:

| ChatGPT/Claude.ai | OpenClaw |
|-------------------|----------|
| Chat only | Chat + take action |
| Lives in a browser tab | Runs on your machine |
| Forgets you between sessions | Persistent memory |
| You go to it | It comes to you (phone, Telegram, etc.) |
| No file access | Can read/write your files |
| No system access | Can run commands, automate tasks |

## What About Claude Code?

If you've used Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool), OpenClaw will feel familiar. Both can:

- Read and write files
- Run shell commands
- Help you code
- Browse the web

**The difference:** Claude Code is a developer tool you run in your terminal when you need it. OpenClaw is always running in the background, waiting for you.

| Claude Code | OpenClaw |
|-------------|----------|
| Run it when you need it | Always on |
| Terminal only | Terminal, web, phone, Telegram, etc. |
| Session-based | Persistent memory across sessions |
| You sit at your computer | Text it from anywhere |

Think of Claude Code as a power tool you pick up. OpenClaw is more like a personal assistant who's always available.

## What's In The Box?

OpenClaw bundles several capabilities that would otherwise require stitching together yourself:

### Always-On Agent
Runs as a background service. Your computer (or server) becomes an AI-powered assistant you can reach anytime.

### Multi-Channel Access
Talk to it however you want:
- **Web UI** - Browser-based chat interface
- **TUI** - Terminal interface for power users
- **Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, iMessage** - Text it from your phone
- **Slack** - Use it in your workspace

### System Access
It can actually do things:
- Read and write files
- Run shell commands
- Browse the web with a real browser (Chrome automation)
- Schedule recurring tasks

### Persistent Memory
Remembers context across conversations. Tell it your preferences once—it learns over time.

### Extensible Skills
Community-built skills for specific tasks. Or it can create its own tools as needed.

### Your Choice of AI
Works with Claude, GPT, or local models. Bring your own API key.

## Who Is This For?

**Power users** who want an AI that can actually help with their computer, not just chat about it.

**Developers** who want something like Claude Code but accessible from anywhere.

**Tinkerers** who want to automate their digital life with AI.

**Anyone** who's thought "I wish I could just text my computer and have it do things."

## What Makes It Different?

None of these features are unique on their own. You could:
- Use ChatGPT for conversations
- Use Claude Code for file/system access
- Use Zapier for automation
- Use a notes app for memory
- Build your own Telegram bot

OpenClaw's value is putting it all together in one cohesive package:

- Open source (MIT license)
- Self-hosted (your data stays yours)
- Well-designed defaults
- Active community
- Works out of the box

It's the difference between buying furniture and assembling IKEA parts from five different stores.
